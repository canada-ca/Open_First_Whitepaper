## Introduction

This whitepaper captures the Government of Canada's (GC) approach to move
towards a more open environment. While the GC has been operating in an open
manner in some places, this will be our first attempt to bring all of these
efforts together to more purposefully improve service delivery to the public.
This includes changes in how we work, purchase, and provide information and
services. Recognizing that as Canadians, and our partners become increasingly
digital, the same must happen to our workforce. This whitepaper will outline the
activities that support becoming more open in our digital society.

This direction is coming from the top, supported by the Prime Minister, in
October, 2017, the President of the Treasury Board (TB) signed a
[Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) concerning Digital Government](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/memorandum-understanding-concerning-digital-government.html)
with the United Kingdom. This MOU outlines the need to work together to provide
public services in an open manner based on the following [Digital 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_5),
Principles: User Needs, Open Standards, Open Source Software, Open Markets, Open
Government and Assisted Digital.

The GC’s continuous utilization of open source software (OSS) can be found in
Environment Canada’s weather infrastructure, TBS’s Government of Canada 2.0
tools (i.e. GCpedia and GCconnex), the Open Data Platform, as well as in
multiple departments openly contributing to the Web Experience Toolkit OSS
project on GitHub ([Source](http://www.ssc-spc.gc.ca/pages/itir-triti/itir-triti-afac-271115-pres1-eng.html)).
Although prevalent, there has been little done to update GC policies,
governance, funding and processes to ensure that open source tools are being
used at the right place and at the right time. Moreover, a need exists to ensure
that OSS are supported in a sustainable way, and there is appropriate policy and
guidance for employees using these tools when needed.

This whitepaper aims to demystify GC’s current use of OSS tools, programs and
activities. It also aims to identify current gaps to outline a path forward in
creating a more complete open environment.

### Objectives

This whitepaper is being co-developed by members of the GC open source community
in an effort to get the full-picture of open in the GC. Once we can better
understand our use of open tools, programs and activities, we can find new ways
to work, build and provide services. While we have made a first attempt at
gathering research, including best practices and jurisdictional case studies,
there are still gaps where community members can contribute. If you have
something to add, we would encourage you to contribute your thoughts, expertise
and references.

We want to learn from Canadians, our partners, academics and technical experts
to help us incorporate an open lens as we update GC policies, governance,
funding and processes.

### GC Digital Principles (DRAFT)

Inspired by of the United Kingdom Government, the Government of Ontario and
other jurisdictions, the GC has recently published [Draft Digital Principles](http://open.canada.ca/en/blog/digital-principles)
to guide digital development in the Government of Canada. These will shape how
we approach managing our information, our technology, and providing services.

Three key principles that have guided this whitepaper are open culture, user
needs, and interoperability. As you will learn, these concepts permeate all
sections of this paper, therefore, we have expanded on this below.

#### Acting Open

Being self aware of how we do our business is key. Conversations about how to
break down silos between departments, our conversations with our partners,
academia and the public continue to evolve. The use of open tools, practices,
and involvement in open communities will help us to break through these silos
and more directly connect people, ideas, tools, information, and services.

#### User Needs

Gone are the days of designing a program, service, or tool without talking to
the person who is going to be using it. Consultations, user experience testing,
public opinion research are all important aspects of how we do business, and
will continue to do business in the future. Once we incorporate the needs of our
users, we can build services that help them with task they want to do more
effectively and efficiently, and most importantly without having to understand
government. This shift will require leaving behind many assumptions.

#### Interoperability

Individuals, businesses, the public, institutions and things all communicate via
computer exchanges. These computer exchanges have become an essential conduit,
and their overall heterogeneity is an even greater reason for interoperability,
meaning the ability to make a variety of information systems communicate with
one another.  A lack of interoperability can lead, at best, to a breakdown in
communication or operations and, at worst, to an outright loss of access to
valuable information.
